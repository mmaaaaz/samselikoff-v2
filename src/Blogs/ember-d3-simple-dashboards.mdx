**Update 9/26/13:** I gave an updated version of this talk in September. There's no video, but you can find the materials [here](/blog/updated-ember-d3-talk). The big changes are the upgrade to Ember 1.0, and the use of components over views.

Last night I gave a talk at the [Boston Ember.js](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Ember-js/) meetup group. Here are the materials from my presentation.
