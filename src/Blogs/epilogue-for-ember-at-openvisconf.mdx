Friends of OpenVis Conf - I did an injustice to you. I presented but a cursory overview to one of the most complex, exciting and powerful JavaScript frameworks of our time: Ember.js.

Fear not! For I have remedied this with a **52-minute talk** just for you, chock-full of Ember and D3 goodness. (Okay, it's also for any other people out there who may be interested. But it's mainly for you.)

Please let me know if you have any questions. It was an absolute pleasure to meet you all, and I hope to see you next year.
