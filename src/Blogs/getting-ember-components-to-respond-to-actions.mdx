import mapUrl from 'public/blog-assets/getting-ember-components-to-respond-to-actions/map.png'

I'm building a map application in Ember, and I need one of my components to invoke a method in another component. The UI is similar to Google Maps, with an overlay panel showing details about the selected pin:

<img src={mapUrl} />

The router looks something like this:

```js
App.Router.map(function () {
  this.resource('pins', { path: '/' }, function () {
    this.resource('pin', { path: '/:pin_id' })
  })
})
```

and when the user selects a pin, the overlay panel appears. The map making up the main screen is a `FullscreenMapComponent`, and the portion corresponding to "Street View" in the Google snapshot is a `StreetViewComponent`.

**The problem**

When the user clicks "Street View", we want the main map to pan and zoom to the selected pin. How can we accomplish this? The `StreetViewComponent` is in the `PinController`, and the map is a completely seprate component in a different controller.

Using data-binding we could introduce a dummy property, have the street view component change that property, and have the fullscreen component respond to changes on that property; but this feels hackish, and the dummy variable wouldn't really represent anything meaningful in our application.

What we really want is for our `StreetViewComponent` to send out an action called, say, `focusSelectedPin`, and then have our `FullscreenMapComponent` respond to that action and invoke the appropriate method. However, if we send out an action from our street view, whichever controller or route that handles the action won't have a reference to the `FullscreenMapComponent`, so it won't be able to invoke any of the component's methods.

**The solution**

We can solve this problem by having our fullscreen component register a reference to itself upon initialization.

First, add a method to the component that executes on init:

```js
App.FullscreenMapComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
  // ...

  _registerWithTarget: Ember.observer('init', function () {
    this.set('register-as', this) // register-as is a new property
  }),
})
```

Then, when rendering the component, supply a property to bind `register-as` to:

```handlebars
<!-- templates/pins.hbs -->

{{fullscreen-map data=mapData register-as=fullscreenMap}}
```

Now, our controller has a reference to the component, and can call methods directly on it. For example, if clicking our street view component sends out a `focusSelectedPin` action, we could handle it like this:

```js
App.PinsRoute = Em.Route.extend({
  // ...

  actions: {
    focusSelectedPin: function () {
      this.controller.get('fullscreenMap').panToSelectedPin()
    },
  },
})
```

Presto! Now our components can respond to actions.
